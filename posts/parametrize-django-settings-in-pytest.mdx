title: Parameterizing Django Settings with Pytest Fixtures

I am currently working on a [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) project and need a way to test different behaviors for a particular setting. After checking the [pytest-django docs](https://pytest-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuring_django.html), I saw that the library provides a `settings` fixture - a great starting point.

Now, how do I parameterize this `settings` fixture? My first attempt, albeit wrong, was:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("settings", [
    {"DEBUG": True},
    {"DEBUG": False}
])
def test_settings_debug(settings):
    print(settings)
    assert settings.DEBUG in (True, False)
```

This changes the `settings` fixture from type `pytest_django.fixtures.SettingsWrapper` into a `dict`, which isn't the result I expected. But it's a step in the right direction.

To achieve my intended result, I introduced two additional fixtures:

```python
@pytest.fixture()
def custom_settings():
    return {}

@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def override_django_settings(custom_settings, settings):
    for k, v in custom_settings.items():
        setattr(settings, k, v)

@pytest.mark.parametrize("custom_settings", [
    {"DEBUG": True},
    {"DEBUG": False}
])
def test_settings_debug(settings):
    print(settings)
    assert settings.DEBUG in (True, False)
```

What do these fixtures do?

- **`custom_settings`**: This fixture allows definition of settings to be parametrized as a dictionary without directly mutating the `settings` fixture.
- **`override_django_settings`**: This fixture runs for every test -- automatically. If `custom_settings` is provided, it mutates the `settings` fixture by updating value of each setting.
